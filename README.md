# Electronics-Store-PoweBI-analysis
# Project Overview
This project analyzes sales transaction data using Power BI to identify revenue drivers, regional performance differences, and product mix opportunities.
The analysis shows that revenue is highly concentrated in a small number of high-value products, with monitors alone contributing nearly half of total sales. Regional performance varies significantly, with Mombasa and Nairobi driving the majority of revenue, while other regions underperform.
Based on these insights, the dashboard highlights clear opportunities to optimize product mix;to ensure that the revenue is spread across multiple products , prioritize high-performing regions, and reduce revenue concentration risk-which is the risk of relying too heavily on a small number of products, customers, or regions for revenue-through targeted sales and inventory strategies.

# Business Questions
This analysis answers the following key questions:
- How is overall sales performance trending over time?
- Which products and categories generate the most revenue?
- How does quantity sold relate to total sales?
- Which regions contribute the most to overall revenue?
- Are there products or regions that are underperforming?
  
# Dataset
# Source: Excel File (included in this repository for reference.) 
# Records include:
    o	Product name
    o	Category
    o	Quantity sold
    o	Unit price
    o	Sales date
The dataset was cleaned and modeled directly in Power BI.

# Data Preparation
The following steps were performed in Power BI:
- Checked for missing and inconsistent values.
-	Ensured correct data types for dates and numeric fields.
-	Created calculated measures using DAX.
-	Modeled data to support efficient analysis.

# Key Metrics (DAX)
Key measures created include:
- Total Sales (Quantity × Unit Price)
- Total Quantity Sold
- Average Unit Price
- Time-based aggregations for trend analysis, such as Month-on-Month.

# Key Insights
- Total sales reached KES 985,800, indicating strong overall revenue generation across products and regions.
- Monitors are the dominant revenue driver, contributing approximately 45.65% of total sales (KES 450,000), making them the most commercially impactful product.
- Revenue is highly concentrated, with monitors, keyboards, and laptops together accounting for ~90% of total sales, suggesting dependency on a limited product mix.
- Mombasa leads regional performance, generating KES 398,114 (≈41%) of total sales, followed by Nairobi (KES 289,000).
- Nakuru underperforms significantly, contributing less than 7% of total sales, pointing to either low demand or limited market penetration.
- Sales value is driven more by product price than volume, indicating that high-value items play a bigger role in revenue than quantity sold alone.

# Business Recommendations
- Prioritize high-performing products (Monitors) in inventory planning, marketing, and supplier negotiations to maximize revenue impact.
- Reduce revenue concentration risk by strengthening sales of mid-tier products through bundling, discounts, or targeted promotions.
- Leverage Mombasa’s strong performance by piloting premium offerings or upselling strategies in this region.
- Investigate Nakuru’s low performance to determine whether the issue is pricing, product availability, or customer demand before scaling investment.
- Focus on product mix optimization rather than purely increasing sales volume, as higher-priced items contribute disproportionately to total revenue.
